## Getting Started

To run any of the example applications, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies

From the root of the monorepo, install the necessary dependencies using `pnpm`:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Build Monorepo Packages

Before running the example applications, you need to build the monorepo packages. From the root of the monorepo, run:

```bash
pnpm build:dev
```

### 3. Set up the License Key

Most of the example applications require a license key to run. You can obtain a free trial license key by registering on the [Microblink Developer Hub](https://developer.microblink.com/license/new).

After obtaining the license key, create a `.env.local` file in the root of the specific example application you want to run (e.g., `apps/examples/blinkid-simple/.env.local`) and add the following line:

```
VITE_LICENCE_KEY=your-license-key
```

Replace `your-license-key` with the actual license key you obtained.

**Note:** The `camera-manager` and `camera-selection` examples do not require a license key.

### 4. Run an Example Application

Navigate to the directory of the example you want to run and start the development server.

For example, to run the `blinkid-simple` example:

```bash
cd apps/examples/blinkid-simple
pnpm dev
```

This will start a development server, and you can view the application in your browser at the address provided in the terminal.
