## 7.3.2

### Patch Changes

#### Bug Fixes

- Resolved issues where EMBind mapped properties with invalid names.

  - `BarcodeResult.rawBytes` has been renamed to `rawData` to match the TypeScript declaration.
  - `MrzResult` now correctly populates the `opt1` and `opt2` fields.
  - Corrected casing in `MrzResult`: `primaryId` and `secondaryId` are no longer incorrectly mapped as `primaryID` and `secondaryID`.
  - Fixed an issue where the `lowerLeft` property in `BlinkIdProcessResult` had a trailing space in its name.
  - Fixed and clarified the type specification for `MrzResult.dateOfBirth` and `MrzResult.dateOfExpiry`: although the runtime values already matched the `DateResult<string>` type, the declaration was previously set to `Date`.

- Removed unused property declarations from `BlinkIdScanningResult`:
  - `inputImagesScanningSide`
  - `barcodeInputImageScanningSide`
  - `documentImagesScanningSide`
  - `faceImageScanningSide`
  - `signatureImageScanningSide`
