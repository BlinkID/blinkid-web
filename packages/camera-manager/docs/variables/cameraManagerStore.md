⚠️ DANGER AHEAD ⚠️

The Zustand store. Use only if you know what you're doing.

Never set the state as this will break the application logic. We do not have
two-way binding. Make sure you only observe the state.

Prefer using subscriptions if you require observable state.

## See

https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand for more details.
