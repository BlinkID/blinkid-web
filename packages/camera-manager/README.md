# Camera Manager

The camera manager is a component that handles managing cameras, video streams and providing frames for usage in further processing.
It doesn't do any processing on its own, and isn't dependent on any SDK.

It can be used with or without the UI component.

Check out the [`camera-manager` example](../../apps/examples/camera-manager/src/App.tsx) for usage.
