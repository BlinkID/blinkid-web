# BlinkID UX Manager

`@microblink/blinkid-ux-manager` parses the results from `@microblink/blinkid-core` and guides the user through the scanning process.

It also controls `@microblink/camera-manager` when it's required during the scanning process.

This package provides a headless component and a UI component which is the feedback overlay used in the camera manager component.
